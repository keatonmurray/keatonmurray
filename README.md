# About Me

I like to build things that other developers or teams can actually use. I approach projects with a product development mindset — not just writing code, but designing tools that solve real-world problems.

Most of what I work on is open-source: extensible themes and plugins that are platform-agnostic and built with flexibility in mind. I'm especially interested in improving developer experience — making things easier to extend, integrate, and maintain.

Though I’m still early in my journey, I’m intentional about how I build. I pay close attention to how systems scale, how other developers interact with code, and how tools can be shaped to fit real use cases — not just demos.
